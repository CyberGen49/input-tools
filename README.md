# Input Tools

This app seeks to provide some useful tools for automating mouse clicks and keyboard presses, including an auto-clicker, keyboard macro recorder, and full input recorder (key presses, mouse clicks, and mouse movement).

This is my first Electron project, so I'm taking this chance to dive into everything Electron has to offer. I'm also pretty new to Node.js, but I'm familiar with browser Javascript, so it hasn't posed many issues.

See the Releases tab to download a packaged version of the app.
